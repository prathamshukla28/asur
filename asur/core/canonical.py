"""Canonical JSON + SHA-256 content hashing - the key-free integrity spine.

This is the ONE place that defines how ASUR turns a Python object into bytes
and those bytes into a content hash. Every checksum, every artifact_id, and
every firewall projection digest flows through here, so determinism matters
more than anything.

Canonical form ("asur.jcs-lf/v1"):
  - UTF-8 text
  - object keys sorted (lexicographically by code point)
  - no insignificant whitespace (compact separators)
  - non-ASCII preserved as real UTF-8 (ensure_ascii=False)
  - exactly one trailing newline (LF)

De-keying note: this is HASHING for byte-integrity and lineage, which we KEEP.
It is NOT signing for authorship, which we dropped. A SHA-256 here proves two
byte-strings are identical; it proves nothing about *who* produced them (that
is identity + gate's job).

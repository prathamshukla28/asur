"""Local identity - ASUR-LOCAL-01.

Identity in ASUR is derived ONLY from the local machine:
  - the OS user (getpass.getuser / `whoami`)
  - git config user.name and user.email (local or global)

There is NO remote auth, NO GitHub login, NO network call, and NO
cryptographic key. This replaces Trinity's SSH-signature authorship proof
with "trust the local git/OS identity". Any local user can clear gates;
the point is not to prove *who you are to a server* but to record, honestly,
*who did what on this machine* so that producer != approver can be checked
(see core/gate.py).

Everything here is best-effort and fail-soft on the identity *fields*
(a missing git name is recorded as empty, not an error) - but the OS user
is always available. Gates fail CLOSED elsewhere; identity itself never
blocks, it only records.

"""Evidence classes - ASUR-HONEST-01.

Every claim ASUR makes about the world (what an audience wants, why a hook
works, how a platform ranks content) must be tagged with how much we actually
know. This is the honesty backbone: the system is never allowed to launder a
guess into a fact.

Four classes, from strongest to weakest:

    VERIFIED_FACT     Something a platform or primary source stated outright,
                      or a definition that is true by construction.
    STRONG_EVIDENCE   Well-supported by studies/data, but transfer to this
                      exact case is by analogy (e.g. ad-recall studies applied
                      to organic feed).
    EMPIRICAL         Observed from THIS creator's own SCRIPT memory / past
                      performance. True for them, not claimed as universal.
    HYPOTHESIS        Plausible, commonly believed, but not rigorously shown.
                      Creator folklore lives here until measured.

A claim is a small record: {text, evidence_class, basis}. ``basis`` says where
the confidence comes from in one short phrase, so the decision is explainable.

"""Export the active habit schedule to an iCalendar (.ics) file (LM-G54).

Each active habit becomes a daily-recurring all-day event from the day it
started, so your calendar carries a gentle daily reminder. Local export only: it
writes a file you import yourself, makes no network call, and links no account
(ASUR-LOCAL-01). Reading habits requires ``lifestyle`` consent, which the caller
(the tracker) has already cleared.

"""Education / course evaluation through the LM05 decision engine (LM08).

The user supplies the salary they expect after the course for each scenario
(conservative / base / optimistic), each with a source reference and evidence class.
The monthly benefit is the LM04 take-home difference between that salary and the
current one (same regime, same payroll deductions) - nothing is invented. A missing
source reference leaves the benefit basis empty, so the decision HOLDs; a scenario
below the current salary gives a negative benefit and BLOCKs.

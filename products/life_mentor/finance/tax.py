"""India income tax for salaried individuals, FY2026-27, new and old regime (LM04).

EVERY slab, rate, limit, and rounding multiple is read from the dated rule pack
``life_mentor/rules/in_income_tax_fy2026_27.json`` through the LM03 loader -
this module contains no tax numbers. Changing a value means editing the cited
pack, never this code.

Computation order (per regime):
  1. taxable income = gross salary - min(salary, standard deduction)
                      - other_deductions (old regime only, user-supplied);
     or the caller supplies taxable income directly.
     Rounded to the pack's ``rounding_total_income`` multiple (s.288A style).
  2. slab tax on the slabs (old regime: basic exemption raised by age band).
  3. s.87A rebate: income <= limit -> rebate up to max; above the limit, where
     the regime allows marginal relief, tax is capped at the income in excess
     of the limit.
  4. surcharge by band on total income, with marginal relief: tax+surcharge
     never exceeds tax+surcharge at the band threshold plus the income above it.
  5. cess on (tax + surcharge).
  6. total rounded to the pack's ``rounding_tax`` multiple (s.288B style; see
     ``money.round_288``).

Scope (always repeated in the report assumptions): resident individual,
salary income only at slab rates, no capital-gains/special-rate income, no
HRA/80C/80D computation.

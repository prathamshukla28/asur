"""Human confirmation of a decision (LM05, LM-HUMAN).

Life Mentor never executes anything. ``record_confirmation`` only writes the
human's choice to the hash-chained decision journal (ids and dispositions, no
money values) so the history shows who chose what, and whether the choice
overrode a HOLD. The report must hash to its own ``decision_id`` (recomputed
exactly as ``analyze_decision`` made it), so an edited report - e.g. a BLOCK
flipped to SHIP - is refused. A BLOCKed option cannot be confirmed: BLOCK means the
analysis found something wrong (e.g. essentials would not be covered).
